The switch to be verified is a 4 port switch which has the following capabilities:

1. Ability to stall the producer port (input interface)
2. Ability to read back contents programmed in the memory interface.
3. Ability to send data in at a different clock frequency.
4. Ability to output data to a slower consumer clock.
5. Ability for the consumer to stall the switch.
6. Update the port names.

The verification environment consists of the basic VMM framework consisting of driver, receiver, scoreboard, interfaces,
mailboxes, environment and test components. 

Stimulus Generation Plan:
o Packet DA: Generate packet DA with the configured address.
o Payload length: generate payload length ranging from 2 to 255.
o Correct or Incorrect Length field.
o Generate good and bad FCS.

Coverage Plan:
o Cover all the port address configurations.
o Cover all the packet lengths.
o Cover all correct and incorrect length fields.
o Cover good and bad FCS.
o Cover all the above combinations.
